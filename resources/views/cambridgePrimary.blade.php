    <h3>Information</h3>    

    <p>Cambridge Primary starts learners on an exciting educational journey, helping them to become confident, responsible, reflective, innovative and engaged. It is typically for students aged 5 to 11 years. </p>

    <p>By offering Cambridge Primary, you can provide a broad and balanced education for your learners, helping them to thrive throughout their schooling, work and life. </p>

    <p>You can shape the curriculum around how you want your students to learn. Because Cambridge Primary is flexible, you can adapt the content to suit your context, culture and ethos.</p>

    <h3>Curriculum</h3>
    <p>With ten subjects to choose from, including English, mathematics and science, our primary programme provides excellent foundations for the next stage of education, as well as plenty of opportunities to develop creativity, expression and personal wellbeing in a variety of ways.</p>

    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>We support Cambridge Primary with high-quality resources to help you plan and deliver the programme, including Curriculum frameworks, Teacher Guides and Schemes of Work.</p>

    <h3>Assessments</h3>
    <p>Choose from a range of optional assessments that prove and improve learning, whether you are looking to assess learner performance, inform teaching or report progress to students and parents:</p>

    <h3>Measure potential:</h3>
    <p>Accurately measuring a student’s potential and progress can transform learning and help you make informed decisions about individual students and their educational needs. Our baseline and diagnostic assessments InCAS or MidYIS from Cambridge CEM, help you measure and benchmark learners’ potential.</p>
    
    <h3>Provide feedback:</h3>
    <p>We encourage you to assess our creative subjects in the classroom through discussion, observation and lesson outputs as opposed to asking learners to sit a test. We provide assessment guidance to help you give formative feedback on the skills you want learners to develop so that they can reflect on, and improve, their performance.</p>
    
    <h3>Monitor progress: </h3>
    <p>Cambridge Primary Progression Tests will help you check learners’ progress at the end of Stages 3, 4, 5 and 6. The tests are marked in school and, from 2022 onwards, will be updated annually.</p>
    
    <h3>Measure achievement: </h3>
    <p>Monitor individual and group performance at the end of the primary programme using Cambridge Primary Checkpoint tests. See how your learners are performing in comparison to the rest of their class and against an international benchmark. Marked by Cambridge International.</p>
    
    <h3>Progression</h3>
    <p>Our primary programme is part of the Cambridge Pathway. This pathway leads seamlessly from primary to secondary and pre-university years. Each stage builds on the learners’ development from the previous one or from other educational systems.</p>

    
    <h3>An integrated programme</h3>
    <p>We believe education works best when curriculum, teaching, learning and assessment align. Cambridge Primary prepares students for the next stage by developing knowledge, understanding and skills across the programme.</p>

    <p>We encourage teaching practice that engages the youngest students in their own learning, and we support our programmes with high quality resources. </p>

    <p>Our view is that assessment should both prove and improve students’ learning, giving them focus, pace and challenge. We organise our primary assessments in a way that maximises time for teaching and learning.</p>

    
    <h3>Wellbeing</h3>
    <p>We understand learners’ educational experiences as being holistic; inclusive of their cognitive, social and emotional development. Therefore, success in education should not solely be measured by learners’ academic achievements, but should also be concerned with learners’ wellbeing – how they feel and function in the context of education. Although we are currently facing unprecedented challenges to learner wellbeing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, wellbeing should not be thought of only as something to consider in a crisis situation. Instead it should be a fully integrated factor in the development and implementation of your school curriculum.</p>

    <p>To support you in integrating learner wellbeing into your school curriculum, we have created a Learner Wellbeing education brief that gives guidance and information on:</p>

    Sustainability
    As part of the University of Cambridge, we consider carefully the social impact of our actions, and how we can improve society and the environment through our products and services. We aim to inform and educate people around the world in order to empower diverse, sustainable and vibrant communities.

    We believe that education is the most powerful long-term solution to poverty, conflict and many of the issues facing the world today. By aligning our work to increase knowledge and understanding of sustainability issues and developing curriculums, publishing research, educational materials and programmes and delivering assessments with the sustainability principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals in mind, we recognise that we can be an even more effective agent for global change.
