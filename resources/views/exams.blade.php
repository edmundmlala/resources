            <h2>Cambridge June Exams</h2>
            <p>
                Cambridge plan for exams to go ahead in June 2023 where it is permitted and safe. This is the fairest and most accurate way of assessing candidates’ performance.</p>
    
            <p>
                Cambridge still have support in place to help schools as they prepare for exams. There are some important changes that you need to be aware of and these include:</p>
    
            <p>
                different criteria, and new deadlines, for applying for component exemptions
                guidance for components and component adjustments are available but will be discontinued after June 2023.
                There is more information on Cambridge Running exams page.
            </p>

            <h3>Running exams</h3>
            We will run our June 2023 exam series as scheduled where it is safe and permitted to do so.

            <h3>Component exemptions, adjustments and guidance</h3>
            <p>
                Component exemptions, component adjustments and guidance for components will be available in our June 2023 series.
            </p>

            <p>
                The criteria for applying for component exemptions has changed – make sure you read our component exemption pages to understand if your centre is eligible to apply.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also apply for special consideration for candidates if they unexpectedly, but for an acceptable reason, cannot take some of the components for which they were entered.
            </p>

            <h3>Entries</h3>
            <p>
                The first-time entry deadline for June 2023 is 21 February 2023. You can make late entries until 17 April 2023, but you will be charged a late entry fee. Please make entries as soon as possible, so that we can get your question papers and other exam materials to you in time for the exams. Courier lead times are currently much longer than before the pandemic and we want to avoid the risk of exam materials not reaching schools on time.
            </p>

            <h3>Question paper security</h3>
            <p>
                All unused question papers and answer booklets must be stored securely until at least 24 hours after the end of the exam or Key Time, whichever is later. After this time you can dispose of the unused question papers or you can return them to candidates/centre staff if you want to.
            </p>

            <h3>Guidance on running exams</h3>
            <p>
                We have updated this guide to support schools who may still be managing some ongoing issues caused by the pandemic. If this applies to your school, make sure you use this guide alongside the Cambridge Handbook when planning the exam series in your centre.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many Cambridge schools are no longer being impacted by the widespread closures and other issues seen at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. If your school is no longer impacted by any issues related to, or caused by, the pandemic then you do not need to use this guide. You should use the Cambridge Handbook, and any other standard guidance we publish for the June 2023 series.
